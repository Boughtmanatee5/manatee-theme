Classes are born soft and supple;
depreciated, they are dead and hard.
Modules are born tender and pliant;
dead, they are brittle and dry.

Thus code that is stiff and inflexible
is a disciple of depreciation.
Code that is soft and yielding
is a disciple of inheritance.

The hard and stiff will be depreciated.
The soft and supple will be extended.
